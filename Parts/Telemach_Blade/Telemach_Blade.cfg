	description = A simple aerodynamic antenna for atmospheric or marine craft, space planes or shuttles. You can send and receive complex telemetry signals within the atmosphere of ANY planetary body! Never lose telemetry again, even during a fast and HOT re-entry! Using patented CloudCutter technology, the antenna is made from an old Frisbee and an elevon, coated with our patented Kerbuminium space-age material, and is guaranteed to maybe not fall apart or burn up during most usage.
