5. Open Kerbal Space Program and assemble a ship

6. Put your assembled ship on the launch pad

7. In your browser, go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
 
8. Click around the Kerbal Spacecraft node to get familiar with the types of telemetry data available
 
9. Say out-loud "3... 2... 1... lift off!" while launching your ship

10. Watch telemetry data populate for your ship, while noticing the understandable looks of jealousy from family and friends

## System Requirements

This package has been tested with:

* Telemachus 1.5
* KSP v1.1.3.1289
* Mac OS X 10.11.6.

_Your mileage may vary._

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for the death of any Kerbalians while attempting to get this to work. Use at your own risk.

## Contributing

I wrote this plugin as an example for those that would like to add new telemetry sources to Open MCT in a rare moment of free-time. I will update it as often as time allows, but would greatly appreciate contributions via pull-requests from fellow enthusiasts.
  
For consistency, please follow the contribution guidelines of Open MCT when contributing to this repo.

## Thanks

A HUGE thank you to the folks at NASA Ames Research Center for open-sourcing their mission control software. This is an incredible time to be alive. I nearly passed out with joy (also _I had been drinking_) when I had real mission control software running on my personal laptop. That's crazy!

A further HUGE thank you goes out to the makers of Kerbal Space Program and the Telemachus plugin. Great work!
